A FHIR® Store with internal, fast CQL Evaluation Engine

## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a FHIR® Store with an internal CQL Evaluation Engine which is able to answer population wide aggregate queries in a timely manner to enable interactive, online queries.

## State

The project is currently under active development. Essentially all official [CQL Tests][3] pass. Please report any issues you encounter during evaluation.

Latest release: [v0.8.0-alpha.10][5]

## Quick Start

In order to run Blaze with an in-memory, volatile database, just execute the following:

### Docker

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 samply/blaze:0.8.0-alpha.10
```

### Java

```bash
wget https://github.com/samply/blaze/releases/download/v0.8.0-alpha.10/blaze-0.8.0-alpha.10-standalone.jar
java -jar blaze-0.8.0-alpha.10-standalone.jar
```

Logging output should appear which prints the most important settings and system parameters like Java version and available memory.

In order to test connectivity, query the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## Deployment

In-deep deployment options of Blaze are described in the [Deployment Section][4] of the Blaze documentation.
